# React Gallery App
#### React Gallery App: Project Overview
The React gallery app is an image gallery app built in a modular fashion to display 24 images
in a page using Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API. <br />
The gallery app has a search component to display searched images, and the searched text is added to the route. <br />
There are 3 default displayed topics that are already setup using React Router.


This react-app runs on a node version less than v13
- Install the latest version of node using  `nvm install --lts`
- After installation, you can check the node version running with `node -v`
- If the version running is still `v13`, use run the command `nvm use v12.18.4` or the version 
installed from step 1
- Furthermore,
- You will need to create a `config.js` in the `src` directory of the project
- In the `config.js` file, you need to add a flickr api key.
- Use this format to add the api key in the `config.js` file.
```
 const apiKey = '';
 export default apiKey;
```
- Now you should be able to run the project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
